Wetleaf is a bizarre combination of hippy commune philosophy, Appalachian mountain folk cults, & Dow-Corning Chemistries. It is the de facto gateway through the Nekalacchia mountains into the breadbasket of the region. The only “safe” highway  into the Nekalacchia Valley passes through the area where the best tech from larger urban areas is exchanged for commodities consisting primarily of synth-meats, veggie-gels, and narcotics. Many of Wetleaf's burbclaves are highly independant and fortified on a level not seen in other areas of similar socio-economic status. Attempts from outsiders to infiltrate the local power structures often prove fruitless. The strict clan structures of the Wetleaf burbclaves all but requires a familial relationship just to get a literal foot in the door. Attempts to circumvent the stranglehold the denizens of the area have on trade to the valley are met with extreme hostility.
