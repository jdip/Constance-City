Burnsey started as a hastily erected stack complex similar to Guerny, but in the early 2080's was devastated by a series of fires that some claim were intentionally set. Whatever the cause, the result was a second building boom chock-full of the most fashionable burbclaves and sophisticated arcologies. Investment in real-estate development became a near guarantee of riches, leading to an unprecedented explosion of building projects toward the latter half of the 2080's that extended up into the newly christened North Burnsey before the bottom dropped out, leaving much of North Burnsey a half-finished wasteland.
