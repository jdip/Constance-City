Franklin is a strictly zoned mix of everything Constance City has to offer. North Franklin rivals Constance Island in glitz, if not security. The eastern and northwestern burbclave complexes between Interstate 321 and the coast offer some of the best middle class living arrangements that can be found, and Central is a less rusty version of the massive industrial parks found in [Trogill]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/trogill.md %}). But the clean veneer of the vibrant burrow beguns to wear thin the further south and west you go, finally succumbing the filth of the stacks creeping out of [Guerny]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/guerny.md %}).
