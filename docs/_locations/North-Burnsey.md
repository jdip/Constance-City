North Burnsey was the result of a building boom that originated in Burnsey in the 2080's. As real estate in the original burrow became scarce, developers looked north for new expansion. But the once roaring population growth of the city slowed to a trickle just as some of the most ambitious project were underway, leaving much of North Burnsey a half-finished, unoccupied wasteland.

One of the most prominent features is the skeleton of a gargantuan arcology known as [The Jungle]({% link _locations/The-Jungle.md %}). Many consider it a last desperate gasp from the crumbling Amazon corporate empire whose failure finally destroyed what was left of the once unassailable corporate entity.
