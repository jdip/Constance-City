Neglected by family to the point that ended up a street urchin in [North Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/north-burnsey.md %})

Picked up by a producer for AKB-47 training program and eventually won a place on Team C4 who operate the [Hollow Point] dance club in [Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/burnsey.md %}). Kicked off of Team C4 for violating the fasion code with cat body mods. [Namba Kiyomi], the leader of [Team C4] was instrumental in getting Konkeo kicked out, over a rivalry for the affections of [Komiko].

Looking to set up a base of operations for her personality cult, and maybe use the power to better society along the way.

[Buta] is her pet a really fat black cat.

Focuses on social media as a way to connect with fans. Leverages fan base to monetize video uploads.
