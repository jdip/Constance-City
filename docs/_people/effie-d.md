Member of nomad pack the [Texiles], that focus on agricultural work. They were kicked out of the Republic of Texas for being too extreme in their far-right beliefs, specifically not paying taxes as it is "government sanctioned theft". They have gone so far right that their clan is setup as a free-love hippy commune. 

[Elder DDik] on the [Council of Pappys] is her father figure within the family. [Nanna Falcone] the head of the [Council of Nannas] is her mother figure.

[Tommy Two Fingers] is a friend who used to be an enemy. They were rivals for the crop dusting spot in the family until Tommy lost many fingers in an "accident". After they became close friends.

Effie does crop-dusting gigs as she can find them. She believes in whole non-organic foods and is driven to improve everbodies lives through better nutrition. Hates kibble.

[Collin Fence Post] was a lover killed in a fight. He thought he could ride a horse better then the rest of us.

[Taylor Slowzy] is an old lover. She thought she could fly better than Effie, they raced to prove it, Effie flew super aggressively and almost killed Taylor. Taylor left soon after to make her fortune in the city.   

[Muldahano] is a farmer Effie used to crop dust for. Bought a ground rig to spray his own crops, Effie snuck in and dusted in the morning before he could use it for the first time and sent him a bill.

[Chuck Yeager] is her pet rat who has his own goggles and rides in a custom pocket on Effie's jacket.
