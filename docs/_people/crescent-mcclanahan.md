Med Tech, joined Trauma Team as a newbie intern. Fell for Trauma Team Security Officer on team [Alex Gonzalez]. Was killed during an extraction where the customer was missing. Seemed like a setup.

[Doctor James] (Dr. Shithead) was the physician on the team and a god-complex dick. He died in a routine call for a car accident and the trauma team was ambushed.

[Jack Armstrong] was the other security officer on the team. The only other one alive. Crescent thinks this might have something to do with an op to save [Steven Lang] who had been shot. Something had been stolen from his apartment and he blamed the trauma team. 

Doctor on team was a god-complex dick. Between that and the death became disillusioned with Trauma Team and started doing gig work. Got called in to treat customers in the aftermath of [Jolly Molly] going cyberpsycho at [Dr. Phil Gud]'s ripperdoc clinic and met [Yoshi Nakamura].
