name: Loare

Exec working for non-profit credit union focusing on urban renewal. [Fist Union] requires all employees spend a portion of their company time participating in a reclaiming project.

Has a pet cat [Izzy].

Bounced around Con City as a street kid in his youth. Applied for a job as a janitor and due a glitch in HR ended up in the wrong interview room, landing a cushy corp job. Is now fond of executive life and willing to do anything to hold on to what he has.

Local media [April Lane] is convinced [Fist Union] is corrupt and has taken an interest in the unusual circumstances of Laore's employment.
