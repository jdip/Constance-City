Former love [Aurora], died on [Fortuna] in suspicious circumstances. Had to flee [Fortuna] before Jaz coudl find anything out.

Former love [Eternity], didn't work out, but still good friends. Jaz wants to get back together. [Eternity] is not so sure. Lives in studio apartment in [Bayside]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/bayside.md %})

Enemy: [Zaeden Derix], the corpo that offered Jaz's family the job that ended in their death. Works for a small subsidiary of [Daimler-VW] ({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _organizations/daimler-vw.md %}), called [ChooTurbo].

Currently freelance hacking, doing oddjobs and datamining for valuable info to sell, willing to bend/break laws lightly if needed when low on cash or on the trail of something good. Mostly focuses on corps/people perceived to deserve some comeuppance. 

Works with a netrunner partner named [Feedback]. Has never met and insists on keeping everything virtual. Jaz has weak suspicions [Feedback] might be a rogue AI.

Looking to build a counter-culture tech-haven without a bunch of corporate bullshit.

Local fixer [Checkmate] wants to acquire Jaz's services exclusively, and is not afraid to flex a little muscle to do so.
